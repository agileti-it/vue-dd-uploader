# vue-drag-drop-uploader

This repo is an example of how to build a drag and drop file uploader with Vue. It was made for a [tutorial on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/drag-drop-file-uploader-vuejs-3/) and is not intended to be used as-is in your production applications. Rather it is a foundation you can use to build your own uploader. If there are bugs or missing features, they will probably not get addressed. If you find solutions to some bugs, let me know and I may merge them in for the sake of the next person who uses this.
